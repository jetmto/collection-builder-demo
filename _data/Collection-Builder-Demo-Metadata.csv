Suzzallo Library is named for Henry Suzzallo, president of the University of Washington from 1915 to 1926. President Suzzallo believed that the library should be the focus of the university, inspiring both mind and spirit. It was designed by architects Bebb and Gould, who were responsible for most of the exemplary collegiate gothic styles on campus. The west wing of the library was built in 1926, and the southeast wing was added in 1935. A glass and concrete addition of 125,000 square feet was added to the north and east sides of Suzzallo Library in the years from 1961 to 1963.

The exterior of Suzzallo Library features eighteen terra-cotta figures in niches atop buttresses. These were selected by the UW faculty in 1923 to symbolize contributions to learning and culture. Allan Clark, a young sculptor from Tacoma, was commissioned to create the figures, which include Moses, Louis Pasteur, Dante, Shakespeare, Plato, Benjamin Franklin, Justinian, Sir Isaac Newton, Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo, Goethe, Herodotus, Adam Smith, Homer, Gutenberg, Beethoven, Darwin and Grotius.","Suzzallo Library (Seattle, Wash.);
